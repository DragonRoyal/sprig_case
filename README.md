# sprig_case
a 3d printed case for the sprig you can print yourself!


# Printing
In most use cases you will want to head to makerworld and directly print it with all presets already chosen but you can also download the 3mf files and download from that.
**Supports should be enabled**.

# Assembly
Once everything has finished printing you can use pliers to remove the support material but it is not needed to, inser your sprig in the case and attach the top cover.

Your sprig case should be ready to work!
